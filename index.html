    <h2>Cricket</h2>
    <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players. It is set on a cricket field centred on a 20-metre (22-yard) pitch with two wickets each comprising a bail balanced on three stumps. For each phase of play, or innings, a batting side tries to score as many runs as possible after striking the cricket ball thrown at the wicket (or delivery) with the bat, while a bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal can include being bowled, when the ball directly hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground. When ten players have been dismissed, the innings end and the teams swap roles. The side with the most runs generally wins, though there are exceptions where the game is drawn instead. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers (one per team) who record all the match's statistical information.</p>

    <h2>Badminton</h2>
    <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.</p>

    <p>
Several codes of football. Images, from top to down, left to right: Association football, Australian rules football, international rules football, a rugby union scrum, rugby league, and American football.
Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball with a foot to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football is understood to refer to whichever form of football is the most popular in the regional context in which the word appears. Sports commonly called football in certain places include association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic football. These different variations of football are known as football codes.</p>
